## 🎤 Voice Narration Enhancement

### Current Implementation
The app uses **Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis)**:
- Automatic text-to-speech
- Fast implementation
- No file hosting needed
- ⚠️ Can sound robotic

### Recommended Enhancement: Pre-Recorded Narration

#### Voice Actor Requirements
- **Age**: 25-40 (sounds youthful but clear)
- **Gender**: Female preferred (research shows children respond better)
- **Accent**: Neutral English (US, UK, or International)
- **Tone**: Warm, enthusiastic, patient
- **Pace**: Slightly slower than normal speech (for comprehension)
- **Energy**: High energy, animated, expressive

#### Recording Specifications
```
Format: MP3 or OGG
Bitrate: 192-256 kbps
Sample Rate: 48 kHz
Channels: Stereo (for richness)
Noise Floor: -60 dB or lower (quiet recording environment)
Peak Level: -6 dB (room for processing)
```

#### Script Examples

**Enthusiastic Version:**
```
"Wow! Let's see what animal THIS is! 
Is it a Lion? A Tiger? A Bear? Or maybe a Wolf? 
Take your time and choose carefully!"

[Correct Answer]
"YES! You're absolutely RIGHT! 
That's a Lion! You're doing AMAZING! 
Ready for the next one?"

[Incorrect Answer]
"Ooh, not quite! But that's OKAY! 
Let's think about it together. 
Every mistake helps us learn! 
Want to try another question?"
```

#### Professional Voice Services
1. **Voices.com** - Professional voice actors ($100-500/project)
2. **Fiverr** - Affordable voice talent ($25-100)
3. **Upwork** - Freelance voice actors
4. **Voice123** - Audition platform
5. **DIY**: Record yourself with good microphone

#### Recording Setup (DIY)
- **Microphone**: Blue Yeti, Rode NT-USB, or similar ($100-200)
- **Environment**: Quiet room, blankets for sound dampening
- **Software**: Audacity (free), Adobe Audition (pro)
- **Processing**: EQ, compression, normalize, de-noise

#### Implementation
Replace Web Speech API with pre-recorded audio:
