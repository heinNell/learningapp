## Volume Levels

Recommended volumes in code (0.0-1.0):
```typescript
correct-answer: 0.6      // Not too loud, encouraging
incorrect: 0.4           // Quieter, gentle
badge-earned: 0.7        // Special moment, medium-loud
level-up: 0.8            // Grand achievement, louder
applause: 0.5-0.6        // Background support
cheer: 0.4               // Layered, not dominant
fanfare: 0.6             // Clear but not overwhelming
success: 0.8             // Victory moment
```

## Implementation in Code

Already implemented in `src/utils/soundEffects.ts`:

```typescript
// Single sound
soundEffectManager.play('correct', 0.6)

// Layered celebration
soundEffectManager.playCorrectAnswerCelebration()
soundEffectManager.playBadgeCelebration()
soundEffectManager.playLevelUpCelebration()

// Enable/disable
soundEffectManager.setEnabled(true/false)
```
